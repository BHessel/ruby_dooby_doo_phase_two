# Rails Code Challenge - Late Show

For this assessment, you'll be working with late night tv show domain.

In this repo, there is a Rails application with some features built out. Your job is to extend this code to add the functionality described in the deliverables below.

## Topics

- MVC
- REST
- Request-Response Cycle
- Forms and Form Helpers
- ActiveRecord
- Validations

## Setup

Clone this repo. Then run `bundle install`, `rails db:migrate`, and `rails db:seed` to install dependencies and set up the database, and run `rails s` to start the server.

## The Domain

The application keeps track of the guests that have appeared on the show.

There are two models in the domain, Guest and Appearance.

## What You Already Have

The starter code has migrations and models for the initial Guest and Episode models, and seed data for some Guests and Episodes. There are also routes controller actions, and views to support listing the guests and episodes.

After running the setup instructions above, visiting `'/guests'` will display all of the guests, and visiting `'/episodes'` will display all of the episodes.

***Schema***

Episodes

| Column | Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| date  | Date  |
| number  | Integer  |
| created_at  | DateTime  |
| updated_at  | DateTime  |

Guests

| Column | Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| name  | String  |
| occupation  | String  |
| created_at  | DateTime  |
| updated_at  | DateTime  |

### Model Methods and Validations

- None

### Routes, Controllers and Views

- Episodes index
- Guests index

## Instructions

1. To log that a specific guest appeared on a certain episode, we'll need to store some additional data. **Make the necessary updates to the schema** so that:
    - Guest can appear on many episodes
    - Episode can have multiple guests
    - Appearance stores guest's rating for an episode in range of 1 to 5

2. A user can fill out a form to **create a new appearance** where they:
    - Choose an existing guest and episode, and add a rating
    - Are redirected to the selected episode's show page after successfully submitting the form

3. On the guests index page, clicking on a guest's name takes the user to a **detail view about each guest**, which displays the:
    - Guest's name
    - Guest's occupation

    ![Showing what happens when we click on a click on the Guest Index page](guest_index_to_show.gif)

4. A user can **view all of the guests for a particular episode**. On the episode show page:
    - List all guests who were on that episode

### Tips

- Remember we want to be RESTful. Which URL should show info about a particular guest? Which URL should show a form to create an appearance? Which controller actions are associated?
- There are probably many ways to set this up.

## Rubric

### Models, Associations, and Validations

1. Models, associations, and validation not started or have errors that prevent the application from running. Missing validations, or validation syntax is incorrect. May have introduced models outside the specified domain.
2. Models, associations, and validations attempted but incomplete or have errors. Associations may construct the wrong relationships. Validations may be missing or applied to the wrong models. Advanced query methods incomplete or have errors.
3. Models, associations, and validations mostly complete and correct per the deliverables. Advanced validations and methods may be incomplete. May have unused or unnecessary code, possibly including duplication. May have written validations instead of using appropriate built-in validations. May implement advanced query methods with iterators instead of using built-in methods.
4. All models, associations, and validations are complete and correct, save minor mistakes in advanced deliverables. Advanced validations are complete and add informative error messages.
5. All specified models, associations, and validations complete and correct. Built-in validations are used when appropriate. Variable and method names are intention-revealing. Models have appropriate logic extracted from controllers and views. Advanced query methods use appropriate built-in methods.

### Routes, Controllers, and REST

1. Routes missing, naming does not follow REST, controller actions incomplete or with errors.
2. Some routing and controller logic implemented, but incompletely or incorrectly. May have routes or controller actions not included in the deliverables. May include routes that have no corresponding controller action or vice versa. Controller methods might do work beyond their responsibility in MVC.
3. Most routing and controller logic working as specified. Some advanced deliverables may be incomplete. Routing follows REST convention. Routing table might include some unused routes, or routes and actions that were not specified in the deliverables. Logic may be duplicated between methods.
4. Nearly all routing and controller deliverables completed, possibly with minor errors in advanced deliverables. Routing follows REST conventions. Some logic may be duplicated between controller actions, or not respect MVC separation of concerns. Attempts to use filters and private helper methods to reduce duplication, but some duplication may remain.
5. All routes and controllers deliverables work as described in the instructions. Routing follows REST naming conventions. Controller actions respect MVC separation of concerns, and don't have logic that belongs in the model or the view. ActionController filters and private helper methods are used appropriately to reduce duplication in controller actions.

### Views and Forms

1. Missing or unattempted views and forms, or erb syntax errors in views and forms. Forms created in the wrong views, do not accept the correct input, or do not submit to the correct location. Data not displayed correctly.
2. Views display some data correctly. Forms attempted, but with some errors that prevent submitting data correctly. May not have attempted or may have significant errors in advanced deliverables.
3. Uses view to show data as specified. At least one working form that submits data to the correct location. May not have attempted some advanced view features. May have included views not specified by the deliverables. May include model or controller logic in the view. Forms may accept invalid input (for example, out of range numbers). May not display validation errors correctly. May not use view helper methods to reduce duplication.
4. Nearly all view and form deliverables complete and correct. May have minor logic errors in advanced deliverables. Mostly does not include controller or model logic in the views. Mostly uses helpers to reduce duplication.
5. All view and form deliverables complete and correct, including advanced form components. No views not specified by the instructions. No model or controller logic present in the views. Appropriate use of helpers and built-ins to reduce duplication. Validation errors displayed correctly on form.
